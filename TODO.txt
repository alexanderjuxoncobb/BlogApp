//TODO:
1. have three types.normal, user who can comment and author who can post and admin who can do all + delete anyone's post
2. so i need to make a client for admin.and i need to change some of these routes exitCode.I p[robably need an admin tag for me ?]

also, try adding an auth so that a user can only delete theior own posts. but an admin can delete any post. we should implement storing posts on aws maybe?

note: good claude chat under the caching user dtaa for faster removeLocalizedDigits. use that as the basis for building this out.

note: need to`:
front end to look nicer (done)
allow to click published vs not. also can they do this from the my postrs page too? (done)
include nextJS ? (no need -- can use if needed in future)
then build and set up the admin side of the app!



bugs:

all posts only published (done)
can't create post in admin (done)
can't unpublish in postDetail (done)
can't view unpublished posts as an admin (auth off)
styling of course (done)
chart is not for my data (done) 


make the delete button that red writing across all 
also ensure the create post and write post ahs consistent styling. like the colours are off etc.
